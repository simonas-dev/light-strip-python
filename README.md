## Music Theory
+ Dynamics in music           - Dynamics of gesture, both its movement in space and changing in brightness
+ Melodic development      - Character and dynamics of drawing
+ Music tempo                     - Speed of movement and transformation of visual images
+ Music rhythm and meter - Spatial and temporal accents in the visual arts
+ Timbre development        - Color development
+ Tonality change               - Development of coloring of the whole picture or color plane
+ Mode changing
(minor and major shifts)   - Lightening ordarkening
